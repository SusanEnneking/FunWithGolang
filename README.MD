# PlayWithGo (and Next.js) #

An algorithm a day keeps the hubris away.  But, if you keep it to < 1/week you really aren't a geek.

## A place to practice with GoLang and Next.js ##

Building skills with go and Next.js by doing a few on-line code/algorithm challenges Next.js and/or Golang

## Main components: ##

1. Client - Next.js page that allows playing with javascript algorithms and showing the result
2. Server - Golang http server.  Just a way to invoke the code via Postman/Next.js.  Probably sould just add more tests, but then how would I dream up a need for a client.
